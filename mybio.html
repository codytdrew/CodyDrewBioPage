        <p>
                I am currently working in the tech industry, which has inspired my new found interest in Web Development. My passions include surfing, music, cooking, and traveling. 
        </p>
        <p>
                In completion of this course, my goal is to begin my career as a Web Developer. As I continue to develop and train my technical skills, I plan to take on many projects, which you will soon be able to find here on my page. I am always looking for ways to continue learning and would enjoy networking with other professionals in the community.  Thank you for stopping by and please feel free to reach out!
